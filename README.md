This project aims to predict traffic situations (e.g., low, normal, heavy) based on vehicle counts, time, and day of the week using a neural network model. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction scripts, with the potential to integrate with a front-end application deployed on Vercel for real-time traffic predictions.

Table of Contents
Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict traffic situations using features such as vehicle counts (CarCount, BikeCount, BusCount, TruckCount), time of day (Hour), and day of the week. The model is a neural network built with TensorFlow, trained on a dataset of traffic observations. The project includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, as well as data visualization to explore traffic patterns.

The ultimate goal is to integrate this model with a front-end application (built with React) deployed on Vercel, allowing users to input vehicle counts and receive real-time traffic situation predictions.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Feature engineering (e.g., Vehicle_Density, Heavy_Vehicle_Ratio), encoding, and scaling.
Model Training: A neural network with regularization and dropout to predict traffic situations.
Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Prediction: A script to make predictions on new data using the trained model.
Data Visualization: Visualizations to explore traffic patterns (e.g., vehicle counts by traffic situation, hourly trends).
Modular Code: Organized scripts for preprocessing, training, and prediction, making it easy to extend or integrate with an API.

Dataset
The dataset consists of traffic observations with the following columns:

Date: Date of the observation (dropped during preprocessing).
Time: Time of the observation (e.g., 12:30:00 PM).
Day of the week: Day of the week (e.g., Monday).
CarCount: Number of cars.
BikeCount: Number of bikes.
BusCount: Number of buses.
TruckCount: Number of trucks.
Total: Total number of vehicles.
Traffic Situation: Target label (e.g., low, medium, high, congested).
Obtaining the Dataset
Public Datasets: You can find traffic datasets on platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. Search for "traffic vehicle count" or "traffic prediction dataset."
Synthetic Data: A script to generate synthetic data is provided in the notebook (project_name.ipynb). Run the notebook to generate traffic_data_train.csv and traffic_data_test.csv in the data/ directory.
Custom Data: Collect your own data using traffic sensors or manual observations, ensuring the data matches the required format.

Copy
import tensorflow as tf
import joblib
from src.prediction import predict_traffic

# Load the model, scaler, and label encoder
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('models/traffic_model.keras')
scaler = joblib.load('models/scaler.pkl')
label_encoder = joblib.load('models/label_encoder.pkl')

# Input data for prediction
input_data = {
    'CarCount': 50,
    'BikeCount': 10,
    'BusCount': 5,
    'TruckCount': 8,
    'Hour': 12,
    'Day of the week': 0  # Monday
}

# Make prediction
prediction = predict_traffic(model, scaler, label_encoder, input_data)
print(f"Predicted Traffic Situation: {prediction}")
Data Visualization
The notebook includes a create_visualizations function to generate plots such as:

Boxplot of CarCount by Traffic Situation.
Scatter plot of total vehicles by hour.
Violin plot of Heavy_Vehicle_Ratio by Traffic Situation.
Run the notebook to generate these visualizations.

Deploying a Front-End on Vercel
To make this project user-friendly, you can deploy a front-end application on Vercel that interacts with the trained model via an API. Here’s an overview of the steps:

Create an API:
Use the predict_traffic function to create an API with a framework like FastAPI or Flask.
Deploy the API on a platform like Heroku, Render, or Vercel (using serverless functions).
Build a Front-End:
Create a front-end app (e.g., using React or Next.js) that collects user inputs (e.g., vehicle counts, hour, day of the week) and sends them to the API.
Display the predicted traffic situation to the user.
Deploy on Vercel:
Push the front-end code to a GitHub repository.
Import the repository into Vercel, configure the build settings, and deploy.
Vercel will provide a live URL (e.g., your-app.vercel.app) for your front-end.
For detailed steps, refer to Vercel’s documentation or request a guide tailored to your front-end framework.
